## Submission Instructions

### Overview

I am creating an app available to my employees in order to streamline requested time off. This app will provide employees with a single calendar space where they can submit requests for time off, post shifts they want to get covered, and get those requests approved or denied.  This idea comes from my current role as a manager. My employees currently request time off by texting me, calling me, and writing notes and leaving them posted in the business. This system is extremely unorganized and difficult to follow for everyone involved.
